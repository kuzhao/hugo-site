> In May 1927, young Charles Lindbergh made a nonstop flight from Roosevelt Field, Long Island, New York, to Paris, France, covering the 33 1/2-hour, 3,600-statute-mile (5,800 km) flight alone in a single-engine purpose-built Ryan monoplane, the Spirit of St. Louis.  
> He received the United States' highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for the feat, while not counting in many other awards and forms of recognition from many countries out of US.
