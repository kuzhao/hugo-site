I'm walking around the streets and buildings, trying to piece together the memories collected during this 1-month visit.

The city sitting at lakeshore bears lots of historic marks. Every winter, there'll be storms across the lake, bringing in lots of ice and snow, while in the summer, people hang around on the giant lake for leisure. Although not everyone likes this climate, it's far from harsh and unpleasant. 

Most of its marks in history spread across the "loop", and the old town, which are southern and northern side of Chicago river, respectively. It's still hard to conceive about the rise and falls of companies, railroads and landscapes, as this area experienced so many changes in the past 150 years, while new buildings are still on the way now. 

My stay here have been going well this time, the second time I caught a glimpse on life in US. During the intervals between weekdays, I managed to get out of downtown and headed for other cities, where things look quite different from Chicago City. 

The lake, pigeons, the 'L'.
